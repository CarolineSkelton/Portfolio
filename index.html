  <!-- Bio -->
    <p>I am a software developer currently based out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
    <p>Before diving into the world of engineering, I worked in libraries for over ten years.</p>
    <p>Some skills I developed in my prior career are:</p>
    <ul class="dark box light-text">
      <li>How to understand different cataloging schema</li> 
      <li>Planning large scale projects and seeing them through</li>
      <li>Working with teams to realize institution goals</li>
      <li>Learning and teaching new technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="break-box light-text">About Caroline</h3>
    <hr class="dot">
    <p>I have a degree in Fiber Arts from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and 
      continue to weave and sew in my free time. I maintain in a studio practice outside of my professional life.</p>

  <!-- Interest in tech -->
    <p>I've started my development career through <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development">Thinkful</a> 
      and I am learning the following skills:</p>
    <ul class="dark box light-text">
      <li>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
      <li>Node, React, and Postgres</li>
      <li>Frontend and backend development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I chose to change careers because I felt the analytical, organizational, and problem solving skills 
      I've built in my library career would be an ideal starting point for a career in tech.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to begin putting everything I'm learning at Thinkful into practice 
      and look forward to collaborating with others to build useful and efficient software!</p>
